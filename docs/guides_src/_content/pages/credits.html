Bonfire would never exist without the hard work and tireless effort to create a high-quality product that [EllisLab](http://ellislab.com) and the Reactor team have put into [CodeIgniter](http://codeigniter.com).

HMVC and the modular basis of Bonfire could not exist without Wiredesignzâ€™s [Modular Extensions HMVC](https://bitbucket.org/wiredesignz/codeigniter-modular-extensions-hmvc).

Migrations provided by code originally written by Matias Montes, then modified by [Phil Sturgeon](http://philsturgeon.co.uk/), [Spicer Matthews](http://www.cloudmanic.com/).

Icons provided by the free [PC 100 Icon Pack](http://pc.de/icons/).

The following Javascript libraries were used: [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), [head.js](http://headjs.com/), [pub/sub](https://github.com/phiggins42/bloody-jquery-plugins/blob/master/pubsub.js) by Peter Higgins, [Ajaxify](http://max.jsrhost.com/ajaxify/), [jQuery Form](http://malsup.com/jquery/form/), [Placeholder](http://webcloud.se/).
