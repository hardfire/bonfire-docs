title: Server Requirements
---

<a name="php"></a>
## 1 PHP

Bonfire strives to keep as close to the current CodeIgniter requirements as possible. At this time, it requires PHP version 5.1.6 or newer.


<a name="mysql"></a>
## 2 MySQL

Bonfire currently recommends the MySQL database engine, version 5 or higher. While it is possible that it runs under different database engines, this has not been tested.


<a name="apache"></a>
## 3 Apache

Currently, only the [Apache HTTPD server](http://httpd.apache.org/) is supported, though with minimal changes it should run just fine under [lighthttpd](http://www.lighttpd.net), [nginx](http://nginx.org/) and similar servers.
